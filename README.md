[M. Tsang](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~tsangm/), [D. Cheng](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~dehuache/), [Y. Liu](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/). Detecting Statistical Interactions from Neural Network Weights, ICLR 2018. [[pdf]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ByOfBggRZ)


## Usage


- Run the demo at "demo.ipynb"
	* the demo trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) on synthetic data containing interactions with nonlinearities. at the end of the notebook the interactions are found by decoding the learned weights 
- requires python 3.6+ and jupyter notebook, tested with pytorch 1.3.1, scikit-learn 0.21.3, numpy 1.17.1


## Reproducibility
If you need to reproduce results, please contact me so I can share the original code used for experiments (in Tensorflow). Email: tsangm at usc dot edu
